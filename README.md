Apache Wave Client for Android
-------------------------------

"Wave in a Box" (WIAB) project is a stand alone wave server and rich web client that serves as an Apache Wave reference implementation.
Apache Wave site: http://incubator.apache.org/wave/
This project lets developers and enterprise users run wave servers and host waves on their own hardware. And then share those waves with other wave servers.
