"Wave in a Box" (WIAB) project is a stand alone wave server and rich web client that serves as an Apache Wave reference implementation.
Apache Wave site: http://incubator.apache.org/wave/
This project lets developers and enterprise users run wave servers and host waves on their own hardware. And then share those waves with other wave servers.

This repository will soon contain a reference implementation of a Native Android client designed to work alongside the WIAB reference server.
